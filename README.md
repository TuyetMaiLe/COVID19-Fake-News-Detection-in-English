# COVID19-Fake-News-Detection-in-English
The COVID-19 pandemic is widely broadcast on fake news to millions of people. Using artificial intelligence to limit the spread of fake news. We used the data from this project Twitter for analysis.
During data analysis, after studying the dataset, we found that Tweets containing links and user names are often real news. Therefore, we converted these objects to a specific format during data preprocessing. For example, @ABC, @EDF into USER. The result is a machine learning model that predicts more accurately.
We also recommended 3 machine learning models to compare.
